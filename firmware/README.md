**Change the USB device in the script
to your device path.**

### esptool
The [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) is needed to upload the firmware over USB.
I used the `esptool` comes with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

### Warning
Some esp8266 have problems with OTA upload after an USB upload. Press the reset button or do a power cycle after an USB upload if you like to do OTA upload.

### espota.py
The [espota.py](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/tools/espota.py) Python script is needed to upload the firmware over the air.
Again i used the `espota.py` comes with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
